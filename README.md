# Hi, I'm Chitransh 👋

## About
I like building small, fast, purposeful tools and iterating in public.

## Currently Building
- Personal site (a simple portfolio website)
- Echo - a chat app (basically, experimenting with backend and frontend)

## Stack (core tools I reach for)
- Languages: (add: e.g. TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, etc.)
- Frontend: React, Vite
- Tooling: Git, minimal configs, fast iteration
- Approach: ship early, refine later

## Focus / Interests
- Simple interfaces
- Fast feedback loops
- Automating repetitive setup
- Keeping things legible

## Recent / Next
- Improving the site content
- Hardening project scaffolds
- Refining build/dev ergonomics
